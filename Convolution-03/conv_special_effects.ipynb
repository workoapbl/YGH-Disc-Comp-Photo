We will provide you 2 kernels $K$ and $J$, which will detect horizontal and vertical edges in your image. We will combine the outputs of the two kernels to achieve our final output using the following equation:\n",

When we apply our kernels for the Sobel operator, we use the **extend** behavior and we **don't clip** until the very end."
